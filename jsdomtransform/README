jsdomtransform : Using env.js for XML DOM modification/transformation
Work-in-progress by Sean Gilligan

Building:
* No build is necessary assuming jsdomtransform is located under the root of env-js project

Transformations:
dom-noop.js          - No changes to the XML 'Infoset'
dom-addclass.js      - Add class="test" to all <path> elements

Testing:
* ./test1.sh         - run the dom-noop.js transformation using ../dist/env.rhino.js (currently fails)
* ./test1-working.sh - run the dom-noop.js transformation with a patched version of 
                         the original env.js (currently working)
* ./test1-patches.sh - run the dom-noop.js transformation with a patched version of
                         a recent env.rhino.js
* ./test2.sh         - run the dom-addclass.js transformation using ../dist/env.rhino.js (currently fails)
* ./test1-working.sh - run the dom-addclass.js transformation with a patched version of 
                         the original env.js (currently working)
